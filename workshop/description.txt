[h1]Space Crusade – Digital Tabletop Adaptation[/h1]

Step into the grimdark universe of the 41st millennium with [b]Space Crusade[/b], now reimagined for [b]Tabletop Simulator[/b]. Command squads of fearless [b]Space Marines[/b] - choose from the stalwart [b]Blood Angels[/b], disciplined [b]Ultramarines[/b], or resilient [b]Imperial Fists[/b] - and launch tactical assaults aboard an alien-infested [b]space hulk[/b].

Fierce creatures like [b]Orks[/b], [b]Genestealers[/b], [b]Chaos Marines[/b], and [b]Androids[/b] stand in your way, while one player takes on the role of the alien adversary, thwarting the mission with cunning strategy and relentless pressure.
